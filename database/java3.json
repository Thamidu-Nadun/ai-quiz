            "question": "What is the correct sequence to execute a Java program?",
            "option_a": "a. Write pseudocode, save as .java file, compile to bytecode, execute",
            "option_b": "b. Write code directly, save as .java file, execute",
            "option_c": "c. Save code as .class file, compile, then execute",
            "option_d": "d. Compile code directly to .exe file",
            "correct_answer": "a",
            "explanation": "The correct process involves writing pseudocode, converting it to Java code, saving it as a .java file, compiling it to bytecode, and then executing the bytecode."

            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a valid Java comment?",
            "option_a": "a. */ This is a valid comment /*",
            "option_b": "b. <!-- This is a comment -->",

            "option_d": "d. `# This is a comment`",
            "correct_answer": "c",
            "explanation": "In Java, block-line comments are enclosed within /* and */."

            "question": "Which of these variable names is valid in Java?",
            "option_a": "a. Tax%",
            "option_b": "b. 2BeOrNot2Be",
            "option_c": "c. DistanceInFeet",
            "option_d": "d. Number Of Values",
            "correct_answer": "c",
            "explanation": "Valid Java variable names cannot begin with digits or contain spaces or special characters like %. 'DistanceInFeet' is valid."

            "option_d": "d. Compile Error",
            "correct_answer": "a",
            "explanation": "Operator precedence dictates multiplication before addition. The result is 5 + (3 * 2) = 16."

            "option_d": "d. Compile Error",
            "correct_answer": "b",
            "explanation": "The '++a' operator increments the value of 'a' before assignment, so b is assigned 11."

        {
            "question": "Which of the following is a correct use of the cast operator?",

            "correct_answer": "c",
            "explanation": "The cast operator '(float)' is correctly used to convert a double value to a float."

            "option_d": "d. None of the above",
            "correct_answer": "a",
            "explanation": "Both conditions in the logical 'AND' expression are true, so the result is 'true'."

            "explanation": "The '+=' operator adds the right-hand value to the variable and assigns the result to the same variable."
