            "option_a": "A. It checks if the script is running on a mainframe computer.",
            "option_b": "B. It ensures that the script runs only on the main thread.",

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The multiplication operation has higher precedence than addition, so 2 * 5 is evaluated first, resulting in 10. Then, 3 + 10 equals 13."
