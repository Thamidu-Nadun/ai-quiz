            "question": "What is the purpose of the 'pass' statement in Python?",
            "option_a": "A. It is used to indicate that a statement is required syntactically, but no action is required.",
            "option_b": "B. It is used to pass control to another part of the program.",
            "option_c": "C. It is used to pass arguments to a function.",
            "option_d": "D. It is used to pass a test condition.",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The 'pass' statement in Python is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used wherever function objects are required."

            "correct_answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This is False due to the imprecision of floating point numbers in Python. When you add 0.1 and 0.2 in Python, you get a number that is very close to 0.3 but not exactly 0.3."

            "correct_answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The '<<' operator in Python is a bitwise operator that shifts the bits of the number to the left by the number of bits specified. In this case, it multiplies the number by 2."
